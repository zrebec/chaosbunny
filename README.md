# chaosBunny 🐰

A cute-rabbit **vertical cave climber** for the browser, built on
[zx-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zx-kit) `^0.32.0` — a modern canvas game
with an authentic ZX Spectrum feel: 256×192, hard pixels, 15-colour palette,
8×8 dither, four switchable playfield looks (bricks / black / mono / authentic
colour-clash), AY music and beeper SFX.

A small rabbit is trapped deep underground. Climb the cave, **collect every
carrot** to open the moon-lit exit, and escape to the surface — past spiders,
outline-wing bats, crumbling ledges and a ladder or two. Dark, atmospheric,
*never cruel*: creatures retreat and curl, they are never killed.

## Play

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
```

Build for production: `npm run build` (output in `dist/`). Pushing to `master`
deploys to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/ci-deploy.yml`.

**Releases are automatic** (semantic-release, same setup as zx-kit): a `feat:`
push releases a minor (0.4.0), `fix:`/`perf:` a patch (0.3.1); `chore`,
`refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `ci` release nothing and don't deploy. CI
bumps `package.json`, prepends `CHANGELOG.md`, tags `vX.Y.Z` and pushes a
`chore(release)` commit — so **always `git pull` after a releasable push**
before committing more. The deploy builds the post-release tip, so the in-game
version readout matches the new release immediately.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `←` `→` | Move |
| `Space` / `W` | Jump (variable height — hold for higher) |
| `↑` / `↓` | Climb a ladder (and descend) |
| `↓` / `S` | Crouch (on ground) |
| `Z` / `Ctrl` | Throw a carrot |
| `L` | **Toggle cave darkness on/off** |
| `M` | Mute / unmute the background music |
| `N` | Skip to the next AY loop (tracks also auto-shuffle while playing) |
| `C` | **Cycle playfield look:** bricks → black background → monochrome → authentic ZX colour clash |
| `B` / `P` / gamepad Start | **Pause** — freezes everything (music, enemies, flames) and shows this key help in-game |
| `Ctrl+Shift+B` | Debug overlay (note: Firefox steals this shortcut) |

The HUD shows carrots collected, floor reached and HP (hearts); the real running
zx-kit version sits bottom-left and the FPS bottom-right.

## Lighting

Darkness is **on by default**. A reusable offscreen canvas draws a dim ambient
overlay, then soft radial cut-outs reveal the cave around wall torches. Each
torch light **pulses like a living flame** — radius and intensity breathe
together on two incommensurate sine waves (never exactly repeating, yet fully
deterministic and tested). The **moon glows too**: dim while carrots remain, full
once the exit opens — a readable goal signal in the dark. The rabbit and carrot
shots emit no light, so torch placement controls what the player can read (a
planned *lantern tool* will give the rabbit its own pulsing light, traded against
shooting). Press **`L`** to compare the dark and fully lit views.

The main tuning constants live in `src/config.ts`: `CAVE_AMBIENT_DARKNESS`,
`TORCH_LIGHT_RADIUS`, `TORCH_LIGHT_INTENSITY` and the `TORCH_PULSE_*` pair. The
removed ZX-dither mode (zx-kit `lighting` + depth gradient) lives in git history
on `master`; `docs/lighting-archive.md` keeps an older 2026-05-31 snapshot of the
pre-zx-kit dither plus the design notes.

## How it's built

- **Hand-authored, fixed levels** (`src/world/level.ts`) — learnable and
  speedrun-able like Manic Miner / Jump King, not procedural. `buildRoomFromLevel`
  turns the tile data into the room.
- **Reachability is tested**: `tests/level.tests.ts` proves every platform is
  climbable by a jump (with head clearance) or a ladder — so tuning the level
  can't silently make it impossible.
- **Everything derives from the rabbit's collision box** (`src/rabbit.ts`):
  platform spacing, widths, spawn — so the sprite can be resized without
  re-tuning by hand.
- **Pixel-perfect** pickups/hits via zx-kit mask overlap (never bounding boxes).
- **AY background loops** — the original Scarborough-inspired cave loop is kept,
  with additional darker cave loops (`Crystal Drip`, `Deep Burrow`). While playing,
  the game auto-shuffles between them every couple of loops
  (`MUSIC_LOOPS_PER_TRACK`); `N` skips manually. Beeper SFX stay separate.
- **ZX-authentic sprite direction** — text-art source rows compile into byte-aligned
  bitmaps and pixel masks. The rabbit is now a compact 24×24 mono-first sprite
  with folded ears, magenta ear/nose accents and cyan shade; the bat uses a
  transparent-outline 24×16 wing-flap cycle whose current frame also drives the
  collision mask.
- **Concept references** live in `docs/concepts/`: `chaosbunny-rabbit-zx-concept.png`
  and `chaosbunny-enemies-zx-concept.png`.
- Crumbling platforms, ladders, a collect-to-open moon, and a Manic-Miner-style
  "gather then escape" loop.
- **Cached rendering** — the parallax dungeon backdrop, the whole tile layer, and
  the static CRT scanline overlay are each rendered once to an offscreen canvas and
  blitted per frame (via zx-kit's `createLayerCache`); the tile cache is invalidated
  only when a platform crumbles or the level resets. A few `drawImage`s instead of
  thousands of per-pixel `fillRect`s a frame — the change that fixed the frame rate.

## Develop

```bash
npm test          # vitest (Node 22+)
npm run build     # tsc + vite build
```

> Built on Node 22+. After bumping the `zx-kit` dependency, run
> `npm run dev -- --force` (or clear `node_modules/.vite`) so Vite re-bundles it.
